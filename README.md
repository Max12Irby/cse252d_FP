# cse252d_FP

Final project for CSE 252d. We will be modifying the DETR object detection framework by changing the encoder (currently ViT) and backbone (currently CNN). Will test performance of: Swin transformer, ConViT, and ViT. Will change out out different combinations of encoder-only, backbone-only, and both merged together.
